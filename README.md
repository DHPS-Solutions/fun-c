# fun-c

Keep in mind all the code here is super cursed and I'm not quite sure what I was smoking when I made this...

A lightweight generic functional library for C.

A lot of functionality is missing...

### Functionality
- [x] Lambda
- [x] Anonymous function
- [x] For each
- [x] Reducing
- [x] Filtering
- [x] Mapping
- [x] Matching
  - [x] Any
  - [x] All
  - [x] None
- [x] Prettier piping
- Adding more goals as more comes to mind.
